Through these methods, we could easily filter the concepts\n            by using the votes of the team members to get TOP 10.</li>\n            <li>After reviewing the TOP 10 we decided to drop 6 more and to continue\n            with those which we considered potentially above average.</li>\n            <li>Once selected the TOP 4 we developed a way to visualize each of them.\n            In the end, we finally concluded with our final concept: The modular box, called\n            \"Triit\"</li>\n            <li>The last step of the process would be to prototype not only the required\n            software of the product but also the modular box to visualize the final product.</li>\n          </ol>\n          <h3>Result</h3>\n          <p style={{paddingRight: '5%', fontSize: '1.5em'}}>After going thought all\n          this step, the result that The orange tree bring was \"Triit\". Triit is a detachable smart box, giving the option to the users\n          can move from the locker to their homes. The service was created to bring\n          more freedom to the user of Posti, allowing them to control 27/7 the parcel\n          from the app and choose where and how they take the receive. The application\n          also offers the user to make their purchase from the Posti platform.\n          This guarantee a faster and easier service for the customer and company.\n          To make the experience more pleasant for the customer, they were able to\n          make their purchase with swiping gestures. Finally, the other main goal\n          of the modular box was to reduce the consume ob cardboard boxes, reducing\n          the waste of plastic and paper.</p>\n          <img className=\"ProjectPic2\" src={PostiLock}/>\n          <h3>My role</h3>\n          <p style={{paddingRight: '5%', fontSize: '1.5em'}}>My main motivation for this project came from my previous bad experience\n          waiting to receive a parcel. During this project, I find out that I was not\n          the only one having this kind of problems. A lot of Posti costumers complain\n          of the lack of information,  the box was damaged, or the parcel ends up on\n          one of the Posti offices. That is why, when we started brainstorming looking\n          for new services, I proposed an alternative option based on the concept of\n          bringing a service that let the customers control the parcel 24/7. The idea\n          was welcomed by the team, and after considering the rest of our proposed\n          concepts, we decided to continue with this one.</p>\n          <p style={{fontSize: '1.5em'}}>As a team member, I participated in all\n          the process mentioned previously and play my role as a UX/UI designer.\n          From all my work I feel proud that the team decided to choose one of my\n          ideas and my role in the design of the box, and the concept of the\n          application. Also, I am very happy with the final result of my presentation\n          of the ten final concepts; in front of all the student, the teachers, and\n          the Posti employees.</p>\n          <h3>Mocks</h3>\n          <p style={{paddingRight: '5%', fontSize: '1.5em'}}>The software used\n          on this project to accomplish the task of prototyping was Sketch. After\n          iterating along the process by testing the mockup and polishing it, we\n          ended up with the following prototype:</p>\n          <div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>\n          <img src={PS1} style={{width:'20em', padding: '1em'}}/>\n          <img src={PS2} style={{width:'20em', padding: '1em'}}/>\n          <img src={PS3} style={{width:'20em', padding: '1em'}}/>\n          <img src={PS4} style={{width:'20em', padding: '1em'}}/>\n          </div>\n      </div>\n    )\n  }\n}\n\nexport default Resume;\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
