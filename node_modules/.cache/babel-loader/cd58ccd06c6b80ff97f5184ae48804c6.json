pretended to have forgotten about a bet just to get\n                    out of paying his dues? With our web application, you can easily keep track of your bets and hold your friends accountable. In one place you\n                    will have an overview of all the bets you currently have running and also be able to see popular bets other people are involved in and join them.</p>\n                    <p style={{fontSize: '1.5em', paddingRight: '2em', paddingLeft: '2em', textAlign: 'justify', color: 'white'}}>\n                    The project started during my stay in Finland as a student of Aalto University together with Carolina Diess and Mario Lopez. Currently, the\n                    status of the application is \"On maintenance\".\n                    </p>\n                    <h3>The Process</h3>\n                    <p style={{fontSize: '1.5em', paddingRight: '2em', paddingLeft: '2em', textAlign: 'justify', color: 'white'}}>With BetsFriends, our intention was to create a platform which allow\n                    to the user to use any wager during his bets, including the non-economic\n                    ones, from doing the washing up for a week to get to throw a cake in somebody's face.\n                    </p>\n                  </div></div>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n              <div className=\"section\">\n              <p>We based the process of our project on the one proposed by Stanford University,\n              which is divided into 5 different stages: \"Empathise\", \"Define\", \"Ideate\", \"Prototype\" and \"Test\"</p>\n              <h3>Personas</h3>\n              <p>We defined three different user groups represented by one persona each.\n              The first one would consider those users who would use our platform to socialize\n              and track their bets with their friends. Secondly, we define those users who would\n              be part of a group, such as sports or university groups, and finally, we thought\n              about families. We consider a potential group of users those couples or siblings\n              who want to challenge each other. Finally, we came out with a fourth group that\n              we considered really interested in this platform, the big companies. We could\n              see some of them launching massive challenges along the net to engage users.</p>\n              <h3>Wireframing</h3>\n              <p>Since we decided to conduct the tests within a high-fidelity prototype\n              in order to simulate a more realistic environment, we designed just wireframing\n              for the main screens of the platform in order to set up a common view of all the\n              members of the group.</p>\n\n              <h3>Features</h3>\n              <p>During the process, we realized that designing the platform for a large\n              desktop was an easier alternative, therefore we decided to start working on\n              the phone version, following the strategy of Mobile-First Design. It is important\n              to remind that our main focus was to offer customer satisfaction as the primary\n              goal meaning that we never forgot about Customer-First strategy.</p>\n              <p>Nevertheless, one main requirement which was set for BetsFriends, was\n              the capability of being used in screen regardless its size, meaning\n              computer/laptops, tablets and smartphones. Therefore we decided to develop\n              the project as a web application, deciding to avoid an Android/IOs applications in the beginning.</p>\n              </div>\n              <div className=\"section fp-auto-height\">\n              <h3>Mockup</h3>\n              <p>The software used on this project to accomplish the task of prototyping\n              was Sketch.
